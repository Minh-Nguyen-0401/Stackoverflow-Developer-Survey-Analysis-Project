> Public 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

## Description:

The enclosed dataset represents the complete, cleaned results of the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, excluding free response submissions. Alongside this README, you'll find three files:

1. **survey_results_public.csv** - CSV file containing the main survey results, with one respondent per row and one column per answer.
2. **survey_results_schema.csv** - CSV file outlining the survey schema, i.e., the questions corresponding to each column name.
3. **so_survey_2022.pdf** - PDF file providing the survey instrument.

The survey was conducted from May 8, 2023, to May 19, 2023. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 17 minutes.

Respondents were primarily sourced through channels owned by Stack Overflow, with the top 5 sources being onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, meta.stackoverflow posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Consequently, highly engaged Stack Overflow users were more likely to notice the survey links and participate.
